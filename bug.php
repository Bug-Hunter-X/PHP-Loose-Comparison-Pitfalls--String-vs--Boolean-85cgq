In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with string comparisons involving loosely typed variables.  Consider this code snippet:

```php
$value = "1";
if ($value == true) {
    echo "Value is true";
} else {
    echo "Value is false";
}
```

This code will output "Value is true" because PHP's loose comparison (`==`) performs type juggling.  The string "1" is considered true in a boolean context.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if strict type checking is needed.  The correct approach is to use the strict comparison operator (`===`), ensuring both type and value match.

```php
$value = "1";
if ($value === true) {
    echo "Value is true";
} else {
    echo "Value is false";
}
```

Now the output is "Value is false", accurately reflecting the difference in data types.
